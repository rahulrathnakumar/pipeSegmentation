Immediate task list for Pipeline Segmentation Chapter

a. MC Dropout uncertainty table 
To do this, you need to modify train.py to train_mcd.py
Table 1: Across RGB-D, RGB-DC, RGB-DNC

Table 2: Across dropout ratios (Too much will kill performance on crack class)

Table 3: Across fusion strategies

b. ???


Immediate task list for the BENN Chapter:

a. Fill out all the inserts where you have to put in references [D]


b. Fill out images for the regression experiments (Need server PC back up again)


c. Fill out images for the microstructure generation experiments 


d. Fill out beam deflection experiment results (Need server PC back up again)


e. VERIFY TPCF algo description [imptt too] 


f. Need to see if porosity alone is enough
